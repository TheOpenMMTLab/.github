# The Open MicroModel Transformation Laboratory (TheOpenMMTLab)

## Context
TheOpenMMTLab is a GitHub organization created in the context of the research projects **FlexiDug** and **SQuIRRL**.  
Its technical foundation is the concept of **MicroModels** and their **Transformations**, applied in **system modeling** and **validation**, with a particular focus on safety-critical systems.

---

## What the Organization Contains
- **MicroModels, Metamodels, and Ontologies** as core research artifacts  
- **Reference implementations** of MicroModel and transformation approaches  
- **Adapters** to load, store, and distribute models in storage services  
- **Specialized repositories for transformations** that can transform specific models  
- **Publications** (e.g., *MicroModel and Transformation* papers and related material)  
- **A Model/Transformation Atlas**, systematically mapping available models, metamodels, ontologies, and transformations and their interrelations  

---

## What the Organization Does *Not* Contain
- General-purpose software development without relation to MicroModels, metamodels, ontologies, or transformations  
- Tools or repositories without connection to **system modeling** or **validation**  
- Administrative project documentation (e.g., funding proposals, management reports)  
- Arbitrary research datasets not directly linked to the MicroModel and transformation approach  

---

## Goals
- **Collect and present** MicroModels, metamodels, ontologies, and transformations from FlexiDug & SQuIRRL  
- Provide **reference implementations** for the research community  
- Enable a **systematic mapping** of models, metamodels, ontologies, and transformations (the Atlas)  
- Promote **open access and reuse** (Open Source) for further community-driven development  
- Establish a **long-term platform** for research and application of MicroModels and transformations in **system modeling and validation**

## Get Involved
TheOpenMMTLab is open for contributions and collaboration.  
If you are working with MicroModels, metamodels, ontologies, transformations, or system validation in safety-critical contexts, feel free to fork, contribute, or open issues.
